# Jeet Kavaiya — AI Learning Journey

Hi — I’m **Jeet Kavaiya**, currently pursuing an MS in **Artificial Intelligence** at the *University at Buffalo*. This short README captures the path I’ve taken so far, the tools I know, the projects I’ve worked on, and where I want to go next.

## About

I started exploring AI during the third year of my undergraduate program. What began as curiosity quickly grew into a focused effort: learning Python, understanding how data works, and building simple machine learning models. I prefer practical, hands-on learning — writing code, running experiments, and improving step by step.

## Journey so far

- **Foundations:** Began with Python and basic programming concepts.
- **Practical start:** Completed a Machine Learning / Data Science / AI bootcamp on Udemy that covered essential workflows and real projects.
- **Data skills:** Practiced data cleaning, EDA, and preprocessing on a variety of datasets.
- **ML basics:** Implemented standard models and learned evaluation techniques.
- **Deep learning intro:** Started building neural networks and experimenting with modern architectures and techniques.

## Tools & technologies

- **Languages:** Python
- **Data & analysis:** NumPy, pandas
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn
- **Machine learning:** scikit-learn
- **Deep learning & experimentation:** (currently learning) neural networks, frameworks, and RAG concepts

## Projects

I’ve applied the skills above in several small projects and coursework. (Replace the placeholders below with real project names and short descriptions.)

- Phishing website detection
- Heart disease classification
- Movie recommendation system 

## Current focus

I am diving deeper into:

- **Deep learning & neural networks** — training models end to end and understanding architectures.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** — combining retrieval systems with generative models.

## Goals

My near- and mid-term goals are to:

- Specialize in **reinforcement learning** and study algorithms that learn from interaction.
- Build meaningful **computer vision** projects that solve real problems.
- Assemble end-to-end systems that combine retrieval, reasoning, and generation.

## What I can do today

- Clean, preprocess and analyze datasets
- Implement and evaluate classic ML models
- Build and train basic neural networks
- Use common libraries to move an idea from prototype to a working demo

If you’d like, I can:

- Add detailed project pages with code links
- Convert this into a portfolio README with badges and images
- Help write short descriptions for each of the projects listed above

Thanks for reading — I’ll keep this document updated as I learn and build more!
